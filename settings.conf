# A branding component is a directory, either in
# SHARE/calamares/branding or in /etc/calamares/branding
# (the latter takes precedence). The directory must contain a
# YAML file branding.desc which may reference additional resources
# (such as images) as paths relative to the current directory.
# Only the name of the branding component (directory) should be
# specified here, Calamares then takes care of finding it and
# loading the contents.
branding: debian

# If this is set to true, Calamares will show an "Are you sure?" prompt right
# before each execution phase, i.e. at points of no return. If this is set to
# false, no prompt is shown. Default is false.
#
# YAML: boolean.
prompt-install: true

# If this is set to true, Calamares will execute all target environment
# commands in the current environment, without chroot. This setting should
# only be used when setting up Calamares as a post-install configuration tool,
# as opposed to a full operating system installer.
#
# Some official Calamares modules are not expected to function with this
# setting. (e.g. partitioning seems like a bad idea, since that is expected to
# have been done already)
#
# Default is false (for a normal installer).
#
# YAML: boolean.
# dont-chroot: true -> enable OEM
dont-chroot: false
oem-setup: false
# disable-cancel: true
